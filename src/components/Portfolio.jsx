    <p>I am a person of many hobbies and interests. Craft beer Brewing, Bushcrafting, Bladesmithing, WhiteWater Kayaking,
                Camping, Gaming, biking (motor, mountain, and road). I am also a tech enthusiast. All my hobbies involve a certain level of 
                technology and as time goes buy I find myself wanting and learning more about different technologies that revolve around all
                the things I love to do.
